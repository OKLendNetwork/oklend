OKLend.Network is the first fair launch lending protocol solely on OKExChain network that enables users to deposit or borrow various cryptocurrencies using stable and/or variable interest rate.
Depositors provide liquidity to the pool to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
OKLend is a fair-launch project with no pre-sale, no investor, and no pre-mine. So from the beginning, the project is built on fairness and transparency, and the team are confident the project has huge market potential. 
OKLend has different features, such as unsecured loans, rate switching, Flash Loans, and special types of collateral.
OKLend.Network generates a native token, OKL, to offer its holders a discounted fee. In the near future, OKL will also be used for governance and served as the first line of defense against outstanding loans.
Please join the discussion on OKLend community, our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of OKLend.
